            <p>By the evening of the first day, though a seasoned traveler by foot, 
                the drifting sand dunes made the journey that much more formidable. 
                You looked to the heavens to see the first signs of twilight appearing 
                and grumbled under your breath about what lies ahead for yet another 
                two grueling days. As you reached the crest of one of the dues, 
                there lay a camel, saddled and bridled, peacefully chewing its cud. 
                &quot;Praise God!&quot; you exclaimed, &quot;You truly look after the needs of your 
                people!&quot;
                Yet again, you found it strange that such a well decorated beast be out 
                in the middle of a desert with no owner. Perhaps it is lost, 
                or some misfortune befell its owner?
            </p>
            <p>
                Nevertheless, you have a need of transportation which clearly was 
                a gift from God Himself. You pause to ponder what to doâ€¦
