            <p>You fall to your knees and cry out to the LORD for mercy and in repentance 
                for your grumbling against Him. The LORD heard your plea and answered it. 
                The storm made a sudden change of direction, leaving in its wake a small 
                dust cloud that sprayed you with a light mist of sand.
            </p>     
                
            <p>You continue in the direction of the mountain range feeling both parched and hungry. 
            You hear the voice of the LORD urging you on further. 
            As you pass between the rugged clefts of rock you come upon yet another oasis. 
            A stream with date palms surrounding it; a gentle reminder &#8209; submission to God 
            and His will shall reap reward. You quench your hunger and thirst and remain 
            by the oasis for the night.
            </p>
