            <p>You plead for mercy, which you received &#8209; but it came at a price.
                Your belongings and food supply were taken from you as a &quot;bargain&quot; for your life.
            </p>
            <p>You were left alone with a gourd of water (they felt generous) 
                and the clothes on your back.
            </p>
            <p>Spent from the ordeal, and the days walk, you fall into a deep sleep.</p>
