            <p>It was not long after setting sail that a storm formed over the Mediterranean. 
                The ship&apos;s crew bravely fought against the violent  waves, tossing cargo overboard 
                to lighten the load but to no avail. Each man began to cry out to his god to 
                save him, but the waves only became more turbulent and deadly. 
                In desperation , the crew started casting lots to find out who was the cause of 
                such a calamity, and the lot fell on you. You told them that you were running away 
                from the LORD, the God of heaven , who made the sea and land. 
                Terrified, they asked what should be done to you to calm the sea.
