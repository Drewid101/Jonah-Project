            <p>From inside the fish, you cry to the LORD in prayer…
                &quot;In my distress I called to the LORD and He answered me. 
                From deep in the realm of the dead I called for help, and you listened to my cry…
                …When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, LORD, and my prayer rose to you, 
                to your holy temple. Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from God&apos;s 
                love for them. But I, with shouts of grateful praise, will sacrifice to you. 
                What I have vowed I will  make good. I will say, &apos;Salvation comes from the LORD&apos;&quot;
                (Jonah 2 NIV).
            </p>
            <p> 
                The LORD commanded the fish to spew you out onto dry land. 
                The LORD also provided clothing and food. &quot;Arise&quot; The LORD said, 
                “Go to Ninevah and preach to that great city.  THIS time, you obeyed.
